## Features

Core Features:
- User profiles and connections within our community
- Access to our network of entrepreneurs, creators, and professionals
- Modern, responsive UI built with Next.js
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling

Integrations:
- Airtable as our community database (required)
- Google OAuth for authentication
- AWS S3 for profile picture storage
- Email notifications via Resend

## Data Architecture

The application uses Airtable as its primary database, with the following structure:

### Profiles Table (`tbl9Jj8pIUABtsXRo`)
Stores user profiles with bilingual fields (English/Chinese):
- `Name ÂêçÂ≠ê` - User's full name
- `Email ÈõªÂ≠ê‰ø°ÁÆ±` - User's email address
- `Picture ÁÖßÁâá` - Profile picture (stored as Airtable attachment)
- `Company/Title ÂÖ¨Âè∏ËÅ∑Á®±` - User's company and title
- `üåè Where are you from? ‰Ω†ÂæûÂì™Ë£°‰æÜÔºü` - User's origin location
- `Short intro Á∞°Áü≠‰ªãÁ¥πËá™Â∑±` - Brief self-introduction
- `LinkedIn Link` - Professional profile
- `Instagram` - Social media handle
- `Categories/Skills ÂàÜÈ°û` - User's skills and categories
- `I am looking for ÊàëÂú®Â∞ãÊâæ‰ªÄÈ∫ºÔºü` - What the user seeks
- `I can offer ÊàëÂèØ‰ª•Êèê‰æõ‰ªÄÈ∫ºÔºü` - What the user can provide

### Matches Table (`tblfmOco0ONZsxF1b`)
Manages connections between users:
- `Swiper` - ID of the user who initiated the connection
- `Swiped` - ID of the user who was connected with
- `Status` - Connection status (pending/accepted/rejected)

### Data Flow
1. User profiles are created/updated via the `/api/profile` endpoint
2. Profile pictures are processed and optimized before storage
3. Matches are created when users connect
4. The system uses server-side Airtable SDK for all database operations

To customize the data layer:
1. Update the environment variables with your Airtable credentials
2. Modify the table IDs in `src/lib/airtable.ts`
3. Adjust the field names and types as needed

## Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with modern React and Next.js, emphasizing component reusability and user experience.

### Key Technologies
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- React 19
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- HeadlessUI for accessible components

### Common Contribution Areas

#### UI Components (`src/components/ui/`)
These are our building blocks:
- Buttons, inputs, and form elements
- Cards and containers
- Navigation components
- Modal dialogs

#### Feature Components (`src/components/features/`)
Higher-level components that implement specific features:
- Profile cards and editors
- Match interface
- Discovery feed
- Settings panels

#### Pages and Layouts (`src/app/`)
Next.js pages and layouts that compose our features:
- Main discovery interface
- Profile editing
- Match management
- Settings and preferences

### Getting Started with Frontend Development

1. Key files to familiarize yourself with:
   - `src/components/ui/Button.tsx` - Our button component patterns
   - `src/components/features/ProfileCard.tsx` - Profile display logic
   - `src/app/discover/page.tsx` - Main discovery interface
   - `src/styles/globals.css` - Global styles and Tailwind customizations

2. Common development tasks:
   ```bash
   # Start development server
   npm run dev

   # Run linter
   npm run lint

   # Type checking
   npm run type-check
   ```

3. Development Tips:
   - Use the `components/ui` directory for new reusable components
   - Follow existing patterns for component props and types
   - Maintain bilingual support in user-facing text
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Ensure mobile responsiveness

4. Before submitting changes:
   - Test on both desktop and mobile viewports
   - Ensure smooth animations and transitions
   - Verify accessibility with keyboard navigation
   - Check bilingual text support
   - Run linter and type checks

### Design Principles
1. **Mobile-First**: Design and test for mobile devices first
2. **Accessibility**: Ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader support
3. **Performance**: Keep components lightweight and optimize renders
4. **Bilingual**: Support both English and Chinese interfaces
5. **Smooth Transitions**: Use Framer Motion for fluid animations

## Prerequisites

Required for all development:
- Node.js 18.x or later
- npm or yarn package manager
- Airtable account with access to our base (contact maintainers)

Required only if working on authentication:
- Google OAuth credentials

Optional features:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cozy_connect.git
cd cozy_connect
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Copy the environment variables file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

4. Configure your environment variables in `.env.local`:

```env
# Required - Airtable Configuration (needed for all development)
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=your_airtable_api_key_here        # Your Airtable API key for accessing our community database
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=appXPGzvT71UhNsjl                 # Our community's base ID (pre-configured)

```

### Environment Variables Explained

#### Airtable Configuration (Required for all development)
- `AIRTABLE_API_KEY`: Your personal API key for accessing our community database. You'll need to request access from the maintainers.
- `AIRTABLE_BASE_ID`: Pre-configured to point to our community's database. Don't change this unless you're setting up a separate instance.
- `AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME`: The name of our profiles table. This should remain as "Profiles" to maintain compatibility.

#### Authentication Configuration (Optional - only if working on auth features)
If you're not working on authentication-related features, you can skip these settings:
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: A random string used to encrypt session data
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: The base URL of your application
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: OAuth credentials from Google Cloud Console

To set up Google OAuth (only if working on auth features):
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google OAuth2 API
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (type: Web application)
5. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   - http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google (development)
   - https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/google (production)

#### AWS S3 Configuration (Optional)
Only needed if you're working on profile picture features:
1. Create an S3 bucket in your AWS account
2. Configure CORS settings for your bucket
3. Create an IAM user with S3 access
4. Add the credentials to your environment variables

#### Email Service (Optional)
Only needed if you're working on notification features:
1. Create an account on [Resend](https://resend.com)
2. Generate an API key
3. Add it to your environment variables

5. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## Customizing External Services

3. Remove media storage entirely

To modify storage:
1. Update the storage utility functions in `src/utils/storage.ts`
2. Update your environment variables accordingly

### Database
The default implementation uses Airtable, but you can:

2. Use local storage
3. Implement your own data layer

To modify the database:
1. Update the database utility functions in `src/utils/db.ts`
2. Update your environment variables accordingly

### Email Notifications
The default implementation uses Resend, but you can:
